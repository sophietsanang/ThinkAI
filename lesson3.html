      <div class="lesson-subheading">How Do We Use AI Thoughtfully?</div>

      <p>
      Recap: In the previous lesson we covered how AI collects your data, AI privay policies, how to protect your personal data, why AI isn't fair, the dangers of over reliance, and how to make ethical AI choices. In this lesson, we'll focus on how to use AI effectively without over-reliance, why it ocurs, and how to interact with it moving forward.

      <p>
      Consider the student who received a zero on an assignment due to citing fake sources ChatGPT gave her. This is completely avoidable when using the right tactics, as it's important to avoid plagiarism and fake sources when completing any assignment. It's also important to idenitfy biases in AI responses. We are all humans with varying identities. Therefore, identifying certain biases may be easier for one person compared to another. We will discuss how to identify biases with our limited perspectives, as there are about 8.2 billion people in the world!
      </p>

      <div class="lesson-content-box-second">
          <div class="lesson-subheading">1. Why Does Over-Reliance Happen?</div>
          <p>
          Before AI became a popularity among people in the work place, academic environment, artistic spaces, and more, people were not aware of it's capabilities. With this lack of awareness, individuals outsourced their much needed information through primary sources and a quick google search. With AI's evergrowing popularity, people are at risk of becoming too dependent on it. Here's why:
          </p>
        
          <div class="lesson-bullet-title">Lack of AI Literacy</div>
          <p>
          It's very easy to trust a chatbot's output without understanding how it sources it's information. Without this knowledge, it's very easy to assume all of the outputs are reliable sources. Considerably, if someone is fully aware of AI's lack of reputable sources when providing cited information, they'd be more inclined to review the output before copy and pasting the citations into their personal work. 
          </p>
          <p>
          Additionally, if someone is unfamiliar with a task, they can automatically rely heavily on AI, trusting the outputs at a higher rate due to their lack of understanding. Comparatively, someone who knows a lot about a topic can quickly assume that AI is capable of handling a smaller task, in turn, not fact checking the given output. The key here is <strong>user confidence</strong>.
          <div class="lesson-bullet-title">Cognitive Bias</div>
          <p>
              While there are many forms of bias that contribute to the over-reliance on AI, here are a few:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Confirmation Bias:</strong> Users are more likely to accept an AI output that supports underlying, unconscious bias that aligns with their own preconceived notions.</li>
            <li><strong>Ordering Effects:</strong> AI recommendations that are presented early on an found to be reliable may increase user trust, which may persist despite visible errors later on.</li>
            <li><strong>Overestimating Explanations:</strong> Detailed AI explanations can increase user trust, providing a false sense of security. This can increase <strong>user confidence </strong> with AI, while deceasing confidence in one's own expertise.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
          It's clear that user <strong>comfortability and trust</strong> are the core reasons why people may rely on AI heavily. This not only increases and builds AI companies' popularity and financial prospects, but it also <strong>decreases users confidence</strong> in their own skills and supports an unhealthy dependency.
          </p>
        
          <div class="lesson-bullet-title">The Downfall</div>
          <p>
            Having reviewed why over-reliance occurs, it's important to navigate the impacts of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overreliance on AI can decrease cognitive abilities long-term. AI "removes" the need for critical thinking and problem solving, especially when users overly trust AI outputs. Therefore, this matter can impact human-AI relationships, where some teachers are hyperaware of AI use in their class, resulting in an avoidance of teaching AI literacy in schools and academic settings. Eventually, this consistent trend will further the divide between those who are for AI and those who are against it, gradually growing a sense of distrust.
          </p>
        
          <div class="lesson-subheading">2. Fact-Checking</div>
          <p>
              In truth, it's very difficult to detect biases that you are not aware of or unsconsciously subscribe to. With this, it's important to learn how to fact-check AI platforms consistently. The best way to not become complacent with cultural bias is to fact-check everything. This may sound daunting and tedious, but with simple fact-checking steps, it becomes easier over time. The two videos below show the process for basic fact-checking techniques such as cross referencing and lateral reading tactics!
          </p>
          <div class="lesson-bullet-title">What is Lateral Reading?</div>
          <p>
            Lateral reading is the act of verifiying what you are reading rather than simply reading it as plausible information. Instead of reading an article top to bottom, throughout it, you would instead fact-check and verify the the information it claims to be true. When combining this tactic with AI, you can become more equipped with fact-checking AI sources and information before accepting it to be true. In other words, it's better to have more tabs open due to one source rather than to just rely solely on a single source.

      <div class="lesson-subheading">What are AI and ML?</div>

      <p>The term "Artificial Intelligence" is commonplace. You've likely seen artificial intelligence in use and you may even use it yourself. But to learn how to use it safely and effectively, we must first learn about what it is.</p>
      <div class="lesson-content-box-second">
          <div class="lesson-subheading">Artificial Intelligence vs. Machine Learning</div>
          <p> Artificial intelligence and machine learning, AI and ML, are often used interchangeably. In reality, they are not the same.</p>
        
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI):</strong> ability of machine and computer systems to perform human tasks such as reasoning and decision making</li>
            <li><strong>Machine Learning (ML):</strong> branch or subset of AI that uses data and algorithms to help a computer make decisions or predictions</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Machine learning falls under the umbrella of artificial intelligence. There are forms of AI that are not in the branch of ML. For example, a series of if-else statements can mimic human decision making and thus be AI but not ML. For the rest of this lesson, we will focus on ML, since that is the branch of AI that generative AI chatbots such as ChatGPT fall under.
          </p>
        
          <div class="lesson-bullet-title">Forms of Artificial Intelligence</div>
          <p>Examples of AI include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Digital assistants:</strong> software designed to provide information and perform specific tasks. Popular examples include Siri amd Alexa.</li>
            <li><strong>Search engines:</strong> algorithms that refine results without human intervention, and provide other functions such as autocomplete. Popular examples include Google and Yahoo.</li>
            <li><strong>Recommendation algorithms:</strong> algorithms used in platforms such as social media and online shopping to provide personalized recommendations and gather user data. Popular examples include Meta (Facebook and Instagram), Amazon, and TikTok.</li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>1955:</strong> the term "artificial intelligence" is coined at the Dartmouth Conference by mathematics professor John McCarthy</li>
            <li><strong>1966:</strong> the first chatbot, ELIZA is created at MIT</li>
            <li><strong>1986:</strong> the first first self-driving car is invented. It could only drive on roads without other cars and passengers, far from the autonomous vehicles we are familiar with today.</li>
            <li><strong>1996:</strong> Deep Blue, IBM's chess-playing program plays and eventually defeats world chess champion Garry Kasparov </li>
            <li><strong>2011:</strong> IBM Watson defeats Jeopardy champions Ken Jennigns and Brad Rutter</li>
            <li><strong>2011:</strong> Apple debuts Siri, a virtual assistant</li>
            <li><strong>2020:</strong> OpenAI releases GPT-3, a revolutionary LLM</li>
            <li><strong>2022:</strong> OpenAI releases AI chatbot ChatGPT</li>

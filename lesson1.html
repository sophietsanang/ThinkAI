      <div class="lesson-subheading">What is AI?</div>

      <p>The term "Artificial Intelligence" is commonplace. You've likely seen artificial intelligence in use and you may even use it yourself. But to learn how to use it safely and effectively, we must first learn about what it is.</p>
      <div class="lesson-content-box-second">
          <div class="lesson-subheading">Artificial Intelligence vs. Machine Learning</div>
          <p> Artificial intelligence and machine learning, AI and ML, are often used interchangeably. In reality, they are not the same.</p>
        
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI):</strong> ability of machine and computer systems to perform human tasks such as reasoning and decision making</li>
            <li><strong>Machine Learning (ML):</strong> branch or subset of AI that uses data and algorithms to help a computer make decisions or predictions</li>
          </ul>
        
          <div class="lesson-bullet-title">Forms of Artificial Intelligence</div>
          <p>Machine learning falls under the umbrella of artificial intelligence. There are forms of AI that are not in the branch of ML. For example, a series of if-else statements can mimic human decision making and thus be AI but not ML. For the rest of this lesson, we will focus on ML, since that is the branch of AI that generative AI chatbots such as ChatGPT fall under.
          </p>
        
          <div class="lesson-bullet-title">Location Tracking & AI Recommendation</div>
          <p>
            Have you ever opened Google Maps and seen a suggestion like, “You were here last week—want directions again?” That’s AI using location data to make predictions. Many apps track where you go, which can be useful for navigation but risky if you don’t control your settings.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Good To Know:</strong> Some “free” AI apps make money by selling your data to advertisers. That’s why you might get ads about things you just talked about!</p>
        
          <div class="lesson-subheading">2. What Privacy Policies Actually Say (And Why You Should Read Them!)</div>
          <p>
              Let’s be honest—most people don’t read privacy policies before clicking Agree. But these long documents contain important details about what companies do with your data and information. Here are a few things to check in a privacy policy:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>What Data They Collect:</strong> Does the AI app track your messages, photos, voice recording, or location? Some AI tools collect more information than you might expect.</li>
            <li><strong>Who They Share It With:</strong> Does the app sell your data to advertisers or share it with other companies? If you see a sentence like “We may share user data with trusted third-party partners,” it usually means your information could be sold.</li>
            <li><strong>How Long They Keep Your Data:</strong> Some AI apps store your information permanently, while others let you delete it. Always check if you have control over your own data.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Many apps claim, “We do not sell your data,” but then use tricky wording to say they “share” it with partners instead—this can mean the same thing! Be careful!
          </p>
        
          <div class="lesson-subheading">3. How to Protect Your Personal Data – Be Smart, Stay Safe!</div>
          <p>Now that you know how AI collects data, here’s how you can take control of your personal information:</p>
        
          <div class="lesson-bullet-title">Think Before You Share</div>
          <ul>
            <li>Never give out your full name, address, school name, or phone number to an AI chatbot.</li>
            <li>Avoid sharing personal details in social media captions or public posts.</li>
          </ul>
        
          <div class="lesson-bullet-title">Adjust Your Privacy Settings</div>
          <ul>
            <li>Turn off unnecessary location tracking in your phone’s settings.</li>
            <li>Check app permissions—does that AI tool really need access to your microphone or contacts?</li>
          </ul>
        
          <div class="lesson-bullet-title">Choose AI Tools That Respect Privacy</div>
          <ul>
            <li>Before using an AI-powered app, do a quick Google search to see if it has privacy concerns.</li>
            <li>Look for apps that allow you to delete your data easily.</li>
          </ul>
        
          <div class="lesson-bullet-title">Use Temporary or Anonymous Accounts</div>
          <ul>
            <li>If you are trying out a new AI chatbot, use a fake name or a secondary email instead of your real identity.</li>
          </ul>

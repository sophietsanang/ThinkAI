      <div class="lesson-subheading">Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Generative AI</div>

      <p>Generative AI Chatbots are a form of artificial intelligence that specifically fall into the branches of ML, deep learning, generative AI, and large language models. Before exploring the safety and privacy of AI chatbots, it is important to have and understanding of how they function.</p>
      <div class="lesson-content-box-second">
          <div class="lesson-subheading">1. How Does Machine Learning Work?</div>
          <p>Machine learning is the branch or subset of AI that uses data and algorithms to help a computer make decisions or predictions.</p>
        
          <div class="lesson-bullet-title">Machine Learning Techniques</div>
          <p>Machine learning uses a variety of techniques to achieve its goals, whether it is making predictions, generating text, or recognizing images.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Supervised Learning:</strong> machine learning technique that uses labeled training data. Input data maps to a labeled correct output. This teaches the ML algorithm to identify patterns and learn to map inputs to outputs. Popular supervised learning algorithms include linear regression, K-nearest neighbors, Naive Bayes, and decision trees.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Unsupervised Learning:</strong> maching learning technique in which the model learns without explicit instructions or labels. It organically finds structure and recognizes patterns in data. This is helpful in situations in cases with unknown or multiple answers. Popular unsupervised learning algorithms include clustering, neural networks, and anomaly detection.</li>
            <li><strong>Neural Network:</strong> machine learning model that mimics neurons to make decisions. A neural network consists of layers of these artificial neurons called nodes, and uses training data to learn. Neural networks can complete recognition or classification tasks faster than humans can. One example of a neural network is Google’s search algorithm.
            </li>  
        </ul>
          <div class="lesson-bullet-title">Forms of Machine Learning</div>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Deep Learning:</strong> branch or subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to process and analyze information. The “deep” in deep learning refers to the depth of layers in a neural network. A neural network of more than three layers can be considered a deep learning algorithm. Deep learning requires less human intervention, and can learn from its own errors instead of needing a human to manually adjust the algorithm. Deep learning also uses more data and computational power than other forms of ML.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Generative AI:</strong> deep learning model that learns from raw data to create a new output similar to the original data. This new content can be text, audio, images, etc. Generative models draw from training data to create a new work that is similar but not identical to original data. </li>
          </ul>        
        
          <div class="lesson-subheading">2. How does Generative AI Work?</div>
          <p>Generative AI works in three phases:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Training:</strong> training a foundation model on large amounts of data</li>
            <li><strong>Tuning:</strong> adapting and adjusting the model for accuracy, relevance, and specific applications
            </li>
            <li><strong>Generation, evaluation, tuning:</strong> regular and iterative adjustments for accuracy and improvement</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="lesson-subheading">3. How Do Text-Based AI Chatbots Work?</div>
          <p>There are a wide variety of artificial intelligence chatbots that use different approaches and have different focuses. In this lesson, we will focus on text-based chatbots due to the popularity of platforms such as ChatGPT.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Large Language Model (LLM):</strong> deep learning model that works with text and language. LLMs are trained on vast volumes of text to understand and generate natural language. In other words, LLMs are designed to understand and create text like a human.  They can infer from context clues, generate coherent and relevant responses, translate languages, summarize text, etc.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>This is why, as you may have noticed, ChatGPT and other chatbots are bad at math. They are text-focused and text-based models, not calculators. They will put together an answer that "seems right" based on what they have encountered in the past, not calculate a math equation directly.</p>

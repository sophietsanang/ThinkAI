        <div class="lesson-subheading">Why Should You Care About AI and Privacy?</div>

        <p>
        Imagine this: You and your friend are texting about a new pair of shoes you want. A few hours later, you scroll on TikTok or Instagram, and suddenly, an ad for those exact shoes that you just talked about. Coincidence? Not really. AI-driven apps constantly collect data about you–what you search for, what you watch, what you say to chatbots, and even where you go. This data is used to personalize your experience, but it can also raise serious privacy concerns.        </p>

        <p>
            Many people don’t realize how much of their personal information AI systems and/or technologies are gathering. Have you ever used a chatbot for homework help? Played around with AI-generated images or voice filters? These tools don’t just “help”- they also collect and store data, sometimes in ways you might not expect. But don’t worry!        </p>

        <div class="lesson-content-box-second">
            <div class="lesson-subheading">1. How AI Collects Your Data – What’s Happening Behind the Scenes?</div>
            <p>
              AI systems don’t just work magically—they rely on data to learn, make predictions, and improve their responses and performance. This data often comes from users like you. Here are some of the ways AI collects information:
            </p>
          
            <div class="lesson-bullet-title">Social Media Algorithms</div>
            <p>
                Ever noticed how TikTok or Instagram seems to “know” what you like? That’s because their AI systems track: 

            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>What videos you watch, like, and comment on</li>
              <li>How long you stay on a post</li>
              <li>Who you follow and interact with</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This information is used to show you more of what you enjoy—but it also means that AI is constantly analyzing behavior.</p>
          
            <div class="lesson-bullet-title">Chatbots & AI Assistants (Like ChatGPT, Character.AI, and Siri)</div>
            <p>
                AI chatbots seem smart because they remember past conversations and improve over time. But this also mean they:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Store and analyze what you type or say</li>
              <li>Sometimes keep records of conversations to improve responses</li>
              <li>Might share data with the companies that own them</li>
            </ul>
          
            <div class="lesson-bullet-title">Location Tracking & AI Recommendation</div>
            <p>
              Have you ever opened Google Maps and seen a suggestion like, “You were here last week—want directions again?” That’s AI using location data to make predictions. Many apps track where you go, which can be useful for navigation but risky if you don’t control your settings.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Good To Know:</strong> Some “free” AI apps make money by selling your data to advertisers. That’s why you might get ads about things you just talked about!</p>
          
            <div class="lesson-subheading">2. What Privacy Policies Actually Say (And Why You Should Read Them!)</div>
            <p>
                Let’s be honest—most people don’t read privacy policies before clicking Agree. But these long documents contain important details about what companies do with your data and information. Here are a few things to check in a privacy policy:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>What Data They Collect:</strong> Does the AI app track your messages, photos, voice recording, or location? Some AI tools collect more information than you might expect.</li>
              <li><strong>Who They Share It With:</strong> Does the app sell your data to advertisers or share it with other companies? If you see a sentence like “We may share user data with trusted third-party partners,” it usually means your information could be sold.</li>
              <li><strong>How Long They Keep Your Data:</strong> Some AI apps store your information permanently, while others let you delete it. Always check if you have control over your own data.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Many apps claim, “We do not sell your data,” but then use tricky wording to say they “share” it with partners instead—this can mean the same thing! Be careful!
            </p>
          
            <div class="lesson-subheading">3. How to Protect Your Personal Data – Be Smart, Stay Safe!</div>
            <p>Now that you know how AI collects data, here’s how you can take control of your personal information:</p>
          
            <div class="lesson-bullet-title">Think Before You Share</div>
            <ul>
              <li>Never give out your full name, address, school name, or phone number to an AI chatbot.</li>
              <li>Avoid sharing personal details in social media captions or public posts.</li>
            </ul>
          
            <div class="lesson-bullet-title">Adjust Your Privacy Settings</div>
            <ul>
              <li>Turn off unnecessary location tracking in your phone’s settings.</li>
              <li>Check app permissions—does that AI tool really need access to your microphone or contacts?</li>
            </ul>
          
            <div class="lesson-bullet-title">Choose AI Tools That Respect Privacy</div>
            <ul>
              <li>Before using an AI-powered app, do a quick Google search to see if it has privacy concerns.</li>
              <li>Look for apps that allow you to delete your data easily.</li>
            </ul>
          
            <div class="lesson-bullet-title">Use Temporary or Anonymous Accounts</div>
            <ul>
              <li>If you are trying out a new AI chatbot, use a fake name or a secondary email instead of your real identity.</li>
            </ul>
